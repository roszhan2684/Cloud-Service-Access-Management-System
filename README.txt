###Cloud Service Access Management System

This project is a backend system built with FastAPI and MongoDB that manages access to cloud services based on user subscription plans. It includes JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and usage tracking for various APIs.

####Features

* User Registration (open for all)
* JWT Authentication (admin/user roles)
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Subscription Plan Management
* Usage Tracking and Limit Enforcement
* 6 Simulated Cloud Service APIs
* Admin can manage permissions, plans, and users

####Project Structure

app/
├── db.py                 - MongoDB setup
├── main.py               - FastAPI app entrypoint
├── models/               - Pydantic models
├── routes/               - All API routes
├── services/             - Utility functions, JWT, etc.

####Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* MongoDB running locally or remotely

####Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Example .env file:

MONGODB\_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB\_NAME=cloud\_access

####Run the Project

uvicorn app.main\:app --reload

####Authentication

Use /token to log in and receive a JWT access token.

Example Users

Username: roszhan
Password: secret123
Role: admin

Username: john
Password: user123
Role: user

Use the Authorize button in Swagger UI and enter:

Bearer \<your\_token>

####Key API Endpoints

#####Authentication

* POST /token - Login to get JWT token

#####Users

* POST /users/ - Create user (public)
* DELETE /users/{username} - Delete user (admin only)
* GET /users/ - View all users (admin only)

#####Permissions

* POST /permissions/ - Create permissions (admin only)
* GET /permissions/ - View all permissions

#####Plans

* POST /plans/ - Create a subscription plan (admin only)
* GET /plans/ - View all plans

#####Subscriptions

* POST /subscriptions/ - Subscribe user to a plan
* GET /subscriptions/{user\_id} - View subscription
* PUT /subscriptions/{user\_id} - Change subscription
* DELETE /subscriptions/{user\_id} - Remove subscription

#####Access Control

* GET /access/{user\_id}/{api\_name} - Check API access

#####Usage

* GET /subscriptions/{user\_id}/usage - View API usage

#####Cloud APIs (6 total)

* GET /cloud/api1/{user\_id} - Simulated cloud service
* GET /cloud/api2/{user\_id}
* GET /cloud/api3/{user\_id}
* GET /cloud/api4/{user\_id}
* GET /cloud/api5/{user\_id}
* GET /cloud/api6/{user\_id}

#####1. Authentication and Authorization
Login (POST /token)

Log in with roszhan (admin) → Should return a JWT token

Log in with john (user) → Should return a JWT token

Log in with invalid credentials → Should return 401 Unauthorized

JWT Token in Authorization Header

Try accessing admin-only endpoints without a token → Should return 401

Try accessing admin-only endpoints with user token → Should return 403

Try with admin token → Should allow access

#####2. Users (POST /users, DELETE /users, GET /users)
Create User (POST /users)

Create a regular user without any token → Should succeed

Create an admin user without token → Should return 403

Create an admin user with user token → Should return 403

Create an admin user with admin token → Should succeed

Delete User (DELETE /users/{username})

Try deleting a user with no token → Should return 401

Try deleting a user with user token → Should return 403

Delete a user with admin token → Should succeed

Get All Users (GET /users)

Try with user token → Should return 403

Try with admin token → Should return the user list

#####3. Permissions (POST /permissions, GET /permissions)
Create Permissions (POST /permissions)

Try creating permissions with user token → Should return 403

Create one or multiple permissions with admin token → Should succeed

Get All Permissions (GET /permissions)

Accessible by all roles → Should return the list of permission objects

#####4. Plans (POST /plans, GET /plans)
Create Plan (POST /plans)

Try without token → Should return 401

Try with user token → Should return 403

Try with admin token → Should succeed (create plan with API permissions and limits)

Get All Plans (GET /plans)

Accessible by all roles → Should return plan objects

#####5. Subscriptions (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE)
Subscribe a User (POST /subscriptions)

Without token → Should succeed only for regular users

With user token → Should work to subscribe themselves

With admin token → Can subscribe any user to any plan

Change Plan (PUT /subscriptions/{user_id})

With user token → Should allow only if changing their own subscription

With admin token → Can change any user’s subscription

View Subscription (GET /subscriptions/{user_id})

Without token → Should return 401

With user token → Should work if it's their own ID

With admin token → Can view any user’s subscription

Delete Subscription (DELETE /subscriptions/{user_id})

With user token → Should return 403

With admin token → Should succeed

#####6. Usage Tracking and Limits
GET /subscriptions/{user_id}/usage

User checks own usage → Should succeed

Admin checks anyone’s usage → Should succeed

Use Cloud API Multiple Times

Call GET /cloud/api1/{user_id} repeatedly until usage limit is hit → Last call should return 429 Too Many Requests

Try with unauthorized user → Should return 403

#####7. Access Control (GET /access/{user_id}/{api_name})
Check Access

User without a subscription → Should return 404

User with subscription, but API not in permissions → Should return 403

User with permission and usage within limit → Should return access granted

User exceeding usage limit → Should return 429

#####8. Cloud APIs (GET /cloud/api1–api6/{user_id})
Run All 6 APIs

Subscribe user to a plan with all 6 permissions

Call all:

GET /cloud/api1/{user_id}

GET /cloud/api2/{user_id}

GET /cloud/api3/{user_id}

GET /cloud/api4/{user_id}

GET /cloud/api5/{user_id}

GET /cloud/api6/{user_id}

Each should succeed if:

The user is subscribed

The plan has that API in permissions

The usage has not exceeded the limit

Edge Cases

Try calling an API that isn’t in the user’s plan → Should return 403

Try when usage exceeded → Should return 429
